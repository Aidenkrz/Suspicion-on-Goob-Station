  # Suspicion on Space Station Rules

  Glossary:
  - RDM\n
    RDM stands for Random Death Match. This is when a player kills another player without a valid reason.
  - Metagaming\n
    Metagaming is when a player uses information that their character would not know to their advantage. This includes using information from OOC chat, deadchat, or other sources that their character would not have access to.
  - OOC\n
    OOC stands for "Out of Character".
  - IC:\n
    IC stands for "In Character".

  Use votekicks if an admin isn't online to deal with a rulebreaker.

  1. No bigotry, racism, or hate speech.\n
     This includes slurs, hate speech, and other forms of discrimination.\n
  2. No metagaming.\n
  3. No RDM.\n
     RDM involves killing another player without a valid reason. Once is fine, but repeated offenses will result in action being taken.\n
     This rule does not apply to traitors.\n
     Stuff like "Do not come into my house or I'll shoot you" is not a valid reason.\n
     Alive-checks so, "Are you alive? I'll kill anyone who doesn't respond" are also not valid reasons.\n
  4. Do not delay the round as a traitor without a valid reason.\n
  5. Do not post IC information in OOC chats, unless the round is over.\n
  6. Do not post OOC information in IC chats.\n
  7. Do not use exploits to your advantage, if you are unsure if something is an exploit, ask an admin.\n
  8. While this is a NRP server, please name your character something realistic and don't name yourself after real life people.\n
     For example: Don't name yourself "Mr Beast"\n
  9. Please be kind to other players.\n
     No harassment, bullying, or other forms of toxicity.\n
  10. No ERP.\n
     Any form of ERP will result in a ban; I mean, come on, it's a game about killing each other. Not a dating simulator.\n
